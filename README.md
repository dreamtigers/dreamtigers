I appreciate GitHub hosting my code for free.

I do **not** appreciate GitHub using my code for their service, GitHub
Copilot.

Although I highly doubt they'd use any code I've written for it, the **idea**
of them doing so, is not well received.

But the damage is already done. That's why I will not remove existing
repositories, but I will not update them, nor add new ones, as long as said
decision is mine to take.

If you're interested in my code, you can find most of it at [Sourcehut].
